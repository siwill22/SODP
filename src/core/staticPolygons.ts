 *  winding test. Totals +-2pi if `p` is enclosed, ~0 otherwise (verified

 *  polygon). Works in pure 3D vectors, so it needs no antimeridian or pole

 *  the boundary-frame exporter works in vectors, not degrees -- see its own
 *  "antimeridian" note in boundaries.json). `points` is the present-day
 *  ring, treated as implicitly closed (last vertex connects back to the
 *  first), matching how prep_staticpolygons.py stores it.
 *
 *  NOT the same computation as polygonArea() above: fan-triangulating from
 *  an apex and summing signed AREA is apex-invariant (it always recovers
 *  the polygon's own area, whether the apex is inside or outside -- the
 *  spherical shoelace formula), so it cannot answer "is `p` inside" at all.
 *  This sums ANGLES at `p` itself instead, which is what actually
 *  distinguishes inside from outside.
 *
 *  BROKEN for a `p`/polygon pair more than roughly a hemisphere apart:
 *  projecting onto the tangent plane AT `p` (a gnomonic-style projection) has
 *  no way to represent a vertex on the far side of the sphere from `p` --
 *  each `dirs[i]` still comes out as SOME finite direction, so the winding
 *  sum can still land near +-2pi purely by coincidence of how the far-side
 *  vertices happen to project, a false "inside". Confirmed directly: a
 *  compact North America polygon (33 degree radius from its own centroid)
 *  reporting `true` for a Southern Ocean point 173 degrees from that same
